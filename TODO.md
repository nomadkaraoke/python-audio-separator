# Audio-Separator TO-DO list

If you see something here, Andrew is aware it needs to be done, and he will hopefully get to it soon but can't make any promises!
This isn't his full time job, and he's doing his best to keep up with everything.

If you'd like something to be done sooner, please consider trying to work on it yourself and submitting a pull request!
If you don't know how to code, please consider learning - it's free, and anyone can do it! https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/
